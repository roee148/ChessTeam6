## 📝 Project Description
Our project is a classic chess game in c++. 
You play this by pressing the source square and then pressing the destination square, after that you get a feedback for your move.
The special features are check detection and board display after every turn.
What makes our game unique is the inclusion of animations and the ability to customize the board's theme.

## 💡 Main Challenges
✏️ Describe 2-3 major challenges you faced and how you solved them:

Challenge 1: The initial plan of the code structure.
Solution: We wrote everything that a chess game need to have (board, pieces, communication) and also we wrote what method each class responsible for.


Challenge 2: We had trouble with the movement of some of the pieces.
Solution: we searched on google the exact movement of those pieces, and     looked for any edge cases (like other pieces in the way).
